**Disclaimer**

BTrain is my attempt at automating a model railway layout. It is open source and free to use but still experimental: use it at your own risk!

**Concepts**

BTrain uses the following concepts:

- Block: a logical grouping of rails where one and only one train can be present at a time.
- Turnout: an element that guide a train from one rail to another
- Feedback: an element that indicates when a train is present or not
- Transition: any stretch of track between a block and turnout (and any combination of)
- Route: a series of block that a train follows

**Features**

- Support for Markling Central Station 2 & 3
- Automatic discovery of locomotives
- Layout editor
- Locomotives control
- Manual routing
- Automatic routing

**Limitations**

- Does not yet take into account the length of train, blocks and turnouts. This might lead to collision if the train is longer than the block.
- Does not yet take into account true speed conversion. This means the speed of the locomotive is not representative of the prototype model.

**Known Issues**

- The document does not get marked as "Edited" for some changes (probable SwiftUI limitation).
